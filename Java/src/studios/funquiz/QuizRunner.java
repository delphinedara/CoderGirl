//        The program should create several questions, present them to the user, accept the userâ€™s responses,
//        and then tell them whether their answers were correct or incorrect.

        /**
         * Bonus Missions
         * Add a short answer question type that includes validation behavior to only allow the user to enter text with less than 80 characters.
         * Add a couple of more question types to your program:
         * Linear scale: a question that allows the user to provide a numeric response within an integer scale, which may vary from question to question. For instance, it could be 1-3 for one linear scale question, and 1-5 for another.
         * Paragraph: Similar to short answer but allows for responses of up to 500 characters.
         * Add tests with JUnit to your classes.
