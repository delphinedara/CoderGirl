    /**
     * For this studio, you will design and build a console program that allows the user to take a quiz. This means you will have to create some questions, and get some input from the user.
     *
     * First, the questions. We want to be able to handle multiple types of questions:
     *
     * Multiple choice: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which only one may be chosen and only one answer is correct
     * Checkbox: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which any number may be chosen; there is one correct combination of choices
     * True/False: a question that has a true/false answer
     *
     * Design Part1
     * What do these types of questions have in common?
     * What makes these question types different?
     * First, design a base class (called Question) that contains the common features, and design subclasses for each of the question types. For each question type be sure to include:
     *
     * Class name
     * Fields and properties with access modifiers
     * Methods with access modifiers
     * Any inheritance relationship
     * Should any of the question classes be abstract? If so, should any of its methods be abstract?
     *
     * Make sure that there is functionality included to display the questions, to display the possible answers, and to check to see if the answer(s) is correct.
